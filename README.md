# Be-Breeder

### Description: 

Be-Breeder 2.0 is a R/Shiny application for statistical analysis and plant breeding developed by Laboratory of Allogamous Plant Breeding group - Department of Genetics, "Luiz de Queiroz" College of Agriculture, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.

### Contents: 

#### 1.	Learning:  
Experimental Analysis, Diallel Analysis, Index Selection, Correlation Analysis, Path Analysis, Biplot Anal-ysis, and Experiment Designs. Based on the data collected from their own experiments, users may perform statistical tests regard-ing the design adopted and the variables evaluated.
#### 2.	Phenotypic breeding: 
Experiment Designs, Experimental Design Analysis, Index Selection, Path Analysis, Diallel Analysis, Correlation Analysis, and GGE-Biplot analysis. Based on the data collected from their own experiments, users may perform statistical tests regarding the design adopted and the variables evaluated.
#### 3.	Molecular breeding: 
Quality control of genotyping data, Genomic selection, Genomic Association Analysis Studies (GWAS), and Diversity Analysis. Specifically, in the latter, we included the subtopic Discriminant Analysis, concerning the evaluation of the divergence at individual or population levels.
