General information:

Be-Breeder use the package lme4() (Bates et al, 2016) 
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lme4/lme4.pdf) 
this package fits linear and generalized linear mixed-effects models.

The general model:

y ~ fixed effect + (1| random effect)

The model should be written in this sequence:

"y" - represents the trait of interest;

"fixed effect" - represents all the fixed effect to be fitted in the model. 
                 The user should write the fixed effects in a additive sequence 
                 (Eg. "Effect1 + Effect2"). The interaction between two fixed 
                 effects should be written with colon between the factors. 
                 (Eg. "Effect1:Effect2").

"random effect" - represents all the random effects to be fitted in the model. 
                  The user should write the random effects names in a additive 
                  sequence between brackets (Eg. "(1|Effect3)+(1|Effect4)").
                  The interaction between two random effects or between one fixed 
                  and random efect should be written with colon between the factors 
                  within brackets (Eg. "(1|Effect3:Effect4)+(1|Effect1:Effect3)").


ML or REML: This box is to choose between these two variance components estimation 
methods. The default is REML.

Output:

Mean: Mean 
Summary: Sumarize all information in the model. Here it contains criteria for model 
         selection like AIC, BIC, log likelihood. It shows variance components for  
         random effects and estimates for fixed effects.
ANOVA: Analysis of variance for fixed effects
Deviance Analysis: Likelihood ratio test for random effects.
BLUE:
Adjusted Means: adjusted means for fixed effects.
BLUP: Blups for fixed 
Predicted Means: predicted means for random effects.


Example Models

# One site or season:

1 - Completely randomized design: 

    y ~ 1 + (1|Genotype)



2 - Completely randomized blocks design: 

    y ~ Block + (1|Genotype) + (1|Genotype:Block)



3 - Incomplete block design: 

    y ~ Type + Block + (1|Type/Genotype)



# More than one site or season:

4 - Completely randomized design: 

    y ~ 1 + Site + (1|Genotype) + (1|Genotype:Site)



5 - Completely randomized blocks design: 

    y ~ Block + Site + Block:Site + (1|Genotype) + (1|Genotype:Site)



6 - Incomplete block design: 

    y ~ Type + Block + Site + Type:Site + (1|Type/Genotype) + (1|Genotype:Site)
